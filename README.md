# Gomoku
Gomoku game written with Swift for iOS. 

So far, the game logic itself has been implemented, so two human players can play against each other.

I've also written a basic scoring function to evaluate a given board, as well as a minimax recursion to search for an optimal move. Still need to implement alpha-beta pruning for faster moves. 

Also want to implement undo/restart/change board size buttons to make gameplay more smooth, but that'll come later.
