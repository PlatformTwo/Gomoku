# Gomoku
Gomoku game written with Swift for iOS. 

So far, the game logic itself has been implemented, so two human players can play against each other.

So far, I've written a basic scoring function to evaluate a given board, but I still need to implement minimax search for the optimal board, and after that, alpha-beta pruning.

Also want to implement undo/restart/change board size buttons to make gameplay more smooth, but that'll come later.
